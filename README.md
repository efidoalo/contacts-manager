# contacts-manager
A program that provides easy interaction with a previously created PostgreSQL database to manage contacts.
The program allows for searching, deleting, inserting, and listing of contacts based on their first and/or last name(s).
Qeries are made to a table named contact_data in a database named contacts.
Possibly an installer will be included in the future that creates the database/table environment for the program to interact with,
this would involve installing PostgreSQL and its C API library libpq.
